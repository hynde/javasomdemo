<h1>Demo 2: Visualizing a data set</h1>

<font size=+1><em> The second demonstration is more complex.  A
two-dimensional map is taught with data from four classes. As the
result the classes will occupy separate areas on the map.  Classes and
their proportions as well as other parameters may be set by the user,
and this allows wide range of experiments.  </em></font><p>


<img src="images/SOMDemo2s.gif" align=left hspace=8 alt=""> 

The four '<b>pies</b>' shown on the left define the input data
classes.  The pies generate two-dimensional vectors that are uniformly
distributed inside the sector shown in the pie.  The relative
proportions of the classes in the teaching data can be controlled with
the widget on the right of the pies.<p>

On the right is <b>the map</b>.  The map units are displayed as arrows
pointing to the coordinates in the vector of the unit.  When teaching is in
progress, the map is redisplayed once a second and the background
colors of the map units are set to correspond to the color of the class
the vector of the unit is closest to.<p>

Below the map are the <b>control panels</b> to control the
<em>alpha</em> (learning rate) and <em>radius</em> parameters.  The
text field shows the initial value of the parameter.  The next
indicator shows with the red line where the value of the parameter is
at the moment relative to the initial and final values.  The actual
value is also displayed.  Normally the values of the parameters
decrease over time when teaching is in progress.  The STOP button can
be used to stop or to restart the decrease.  RESET resets the value of
the parameter to the initial value.<p>

Finally in the bottom is the <b>control panel</b> used to start and stop the
teaching, randomize the map and reset the parameters.<p>

All widget values can be edited with the mouse.
