<h1>First demo - the SOM learning algorithm</h1>

In this demo we have a one-dimensional map with eight
one-dimensional units.  Initially the map units are initialized to
random values.  The map is trained with random data as input and  as the
result, the map will become organized. <p>

The map can be trained either automatically or manually.  During
automatic training the map is fed with random values at a constant
rate.  In manual training you can yourself select the value used for
training (the input vector) by clicking on the
<a href="demo1instr.html#input">input vector</a>

(the leftmost slider with coloured background) with the mouse or you
can press the <b>SPACE</b> key to teach one step with a random vector.
In both automatic and manual training the state of the map is shown
after each step and the change between the previous and the new state
is shown with the yellow areas in the map units.<p>

Use the <b>START/STOP</b> button to start and stop the automatic
training.  The <b>RANDOMIZE</b> button will set the map units to
random values.  Use the text field to set the <i>alpha</i> learning
rate parameter.  Map units are also editable with the mouse.  <p>

first demo is also available.  But now, lets see that demo:
