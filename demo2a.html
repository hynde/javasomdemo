<h1>Demo 2: Visualizing a data set</h1>

<p class="abstract">
The second demonstration is more complex.  A two-dimensional map is
teached with data from four classes and as the result the classes will
occupy separate areas on the map.  Classes and their proportions as
well as other parameters are user-settable allowing a wide range of
experiments. </p>

<img src="images/SOMDemo2s.gif" align=left hspace=8 alt="">

The four '<b>pies</b>' shown on the left define the input data
classes.  The pies generate two-dimensional vectors that are uniformly
distributed inside the sector shown in the pie.  The relative
proportions of the classes in the teaching data can be controlled with
the widget on the right of the pies.<p>

On the right is <b>the map</b>.  The map units are displayed as arrows
pointing to the coordinates in the unit's vector.  When teaching is in
progress, the map is redisplayed once a second and the background
color of the map units are set to correspond to the color of the class
the unit's vector is closest to.<p>

Below the map are the <b>control panels</b> to control the
<em>alpha</em> and <em>radius</em> parameters.  The textfield shows
the parameter's initial value.  The next indicator shows with the red
line where the parameter's value is at the moment relative to the
initial and final value.  Normally the parameters' values decrease
over time when teaching is in progress.  The STOP-button can be used
to stop or restart the decrease.  RESET resets the parameters value to
the initial value.<p>

Finally in the bottom is the <b>control panel</b> used to start and stop the
teaching, randomize the map and reset the parameters.<p>

All things are editable with the mouse, try them.
