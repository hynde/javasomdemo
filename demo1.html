<h1>The SOM algorithm demonstration</h1>

<font size=+1><em>
The first demo shows the SOM algorithm in a nutshell.  When the
Self-Organizing Map algorithm controls a row of sliders, they
gradually become ordered when random inputs are presented.
</em></font><p>

In this demo a one-dimensional map is represented by a row of sliders.
The sliders, representing map units, are controlled by the SOM
algorithm.  When random inputs are presented, the values of the sliders
gradually become ordered.  During training the difference between the
previous and the new value of a slider is shown with yellow colour
after each training step.  The slider whose value is closest to the
input value (i.e. corresponding to the best-matching map unit) is
indicated with red colour.  The leftmost slider with pinkish
background is the input controller.  It shows the input presented to
the map at each training step.  <p>

The map can be trained either automatically or manually.  During
automatic training the map is presented with random inputs at a
constant rate.  In manual training you can yourself specify the input
used for training by clicking with the mouse on the input controller
(the leftmost slider with pinkish background) or you can press the
<b>SPACE</b> key to teach one step with a random input.  <p>

Use the <b>START/STOP</b> button to start and stop the automatic
training.  The <b>RANDOMIZE</b> button will set the values of the sliders to
random values.  Use the text field to set the <i>alpha</i> learning
rate parameter.  Map units are also editable with the mouse.  <p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In this demo the neighborhood size is constant (radius equals
       one, the winner and its neighbours are adapted).  If more map
       units were used, shrinking neighborhood should be used.
</ul>
