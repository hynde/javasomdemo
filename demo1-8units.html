<h1>The SOM algorithm demonstration</h1>

<font size=+1><em>
The first demo demonstrates the SOM algorithm in a nutshell.  When the
Self-Organizing Map algorithm controls a row of sliders, they
gradually become ordered when random inputs are presented.
</em></font><p>

In this demo a one-dimensional map is represented by a row of sliders.
The sliders, representing map units, are controlled by the SOM
algorithm.  When random inputs are presented, the sliders's values
gradually become ordered.  During training the difference between the
previous and the new value of a slider is shown with yellow
color after each training step.  Also the best matching unit, the
slider whose value is closest to the input value, is indicated with a
red slider.  The leftmost slider with pinkish background is the input
controller.  It shows the input to the map at each step and it is also
used to select user-defined inputs. <p> 

The map can be trained either automatically or manually.  During
automatic training the map is presented with random inputs at a
constant rate.  In manual training you can yourself select the input
used for training by clicking with the mouse on the input controller
(the leftmost slider with pinkish background) or you can press the
<b>SPACE</b> key to teach one step with a random input.  <p>

Use the <b>START/STOP</b> button to start and stop the automatic
training.  The <b>RANDOMIZE</b> button will set the values of the sliders to
random values.  Use the text field to set the <i>alpha</i> learning
rate parameter.  Map units are also editable with the mouse.  <p>
