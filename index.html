<h1>Interactive Self-Organizing Map demonstrations (in Java)</h1>

On these pages you will find two interactive demonstrations of how the
<strong>Self-Organizing Map</strong> algorithm operates.  Two demos
are provided: the first one demonstrates the SOM algorithm for a
one-dimensional map, whereas the second one is a more complex demonstration
with many possibilities for experimenting.  In both demonstrations you
can see the map 'live' as it is being taught.  You can also interact
with the teaching process either by changing the parameters or by
selecting the inputs for the map.

<p>

The demonstrations require a Java-capable browser such as
<b>Netscape</b>.

If you have problems with the demos, see the
<a href="#notes"><b>notes</b></a> at the end of the page.

The first demo shows the SOM algorithm in a nutshell.  When the
self-organizing map algorithm controls a row of sliders, they
gradually become ordered when random inputs are presented. <p>

The second demonstration is more complex.  A two-dimensional map is
taught with data from four classes.  As the result the classes will
occupy separate areas on the map.  Classes and their proportions as
well as other parameters may be set by the user allowing a wide range of
experiments.  <p>

These demos were made by

The demos have been tested with the JDK's appletviewer on SGI and Netscape
2.0 on several UNIX platforms (SGI, HPUX, DEC OSF/1, Linux).  We've tried
them once with Netscape 2.0 for W95 and the display was completely
messed up but it might have been an isolated incident.  Anyway, We'd
like to hear how they work for you. <p>

We have had some problems with the loading of the applets.  The demos
seem to work best if you first go to the first demo and from there
directly to the second using the link provided at the end of the page.
If you come from the first demo back to this page (with the
BACK-button) and then go to the second demo, things may get stuck.
Stopping, reloading, visiting other pages,
etc. might finally get the thing loaded.
